This semester project consisted in the realisation of a road network for the Thymio, an educative robot with many sensors and actuators.

Did in colaboration with Benjamin Kern.

## Folder structure
- _designs_: Tracks and 3-bits barcodes ready to use. Includes also map examples
- _documentation_: Report for the semester project in French and English for the global infrastructure, English only for the local infrastructure
- _src_: Code for the vehicles (Thymio Road), parking traffic light (Signal Parking) and crossroad traffic light (SignalCrossroad)
